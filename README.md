- Written in pure Javascript with some help from the CreateJS canvas library.
- 3d effect is done using a zooming trick that is often called 'mode 7' and was pioneered in the early nineties.
- Graphics and music (you do have your speakers on, right?) borrowed from the Super Nintendo game Mario Kart.
